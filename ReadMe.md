# Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System – Group 16

## Project Summary
This project presents a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing application, modeled after BitTorrent.
It enables multiple peers to exchange file segments through TCP sockets, eliminating the need for a central server.
Core features include intelligent choking/unchoking mechanisms, peer prioritization, and file chunking for faster, parallel downloads.

## Key Features
- Decentralized communication between peers using TCP sockets.
- Dynamic choking and unchoking to prioritize peers based on download contribution.
- File is split into segments for parallel downloading from multiple peers.
- Logging of system events for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## Setup Instructions

### Compilation
To compile all Java files, run:
```
javac *.java
```

### Running the Application
Start each peer process with its peer ID:
```
java Peer 1001
java Peer 1002
java Peer 1003
```

### Demo Video

## Configuration Files

### `Common.cfg`
```
NumberOfPreferredNeighbors 3
UnchokingInterval 5
OptimisticUnchokingInterval 10
FileName tree.jpg
FileSize 24301568
PieceSize 1638400
```

### `PeerInfo.cfg`
```
1001 localhost 6003 1
1002 localhost 6004 0
1003 localhost 6005 0
```

## Core Components
- `refreshPreferredPeers()` – Dynamically selects preferred peers based on download performance.
- `chooseOptimisticPeer()` – Randomly unchokes one peer to ensure fairness in sharing.
- `mergeChunks()` – Reconstructs the full file from received segments once all chunks are collected.

## Conclusion
This system successfully simulates the functionality of a distributed file sharing network.
It demonstrates practical applications of fairness, parallelism, and network programming through peer prioritization and chunk-based file transfers.
